# Git Flow Test repository

### Version: 0.1

* I've added newFeature1 using git-flow
  * This was added in a second local commit for newFeature1

* for feature 2, I will test squashing the feature commits
  * it seems that if I pass `-r` that it will rebase instead of merge when I `git flow feature finish -r feature2`
